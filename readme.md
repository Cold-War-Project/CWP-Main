This mod is a work in progress. Cold War Project Is developed by a hardworking team of volunteers passionate about the challenges of the Cold War era, and the political and economic systems that shape our world both today and into our future. We begin in 1946 following the Paris Peace Treaties with the world in ruins and the future uncertain. Will you lead your nation into prosperity or will you be relegated to obscurity?

Our team's main objective is to preserve the design philosophy of vanilla Victoria — an open ended sandbox without set historical railroading — while also adding dynamic flavor and mechanics to allow for a variety of outcomes. It should allow for a wide variety of playstyles and strategies, and should be fun to play for both casual and hardcore players.
