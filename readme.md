# Victoria 3: Cold War

This mod is a work in progress. It aims to recreate the political and economic situation from the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 through the late 20th century and in into the early 21st century. 

Our main Goal is to preserve the design philosophy of vanilla Victoria 3 by creating a sandbox without a focus on historical simulation. We want to create a mod that is fun to play and that allows for a wide variety of playstyles.

# Features

* A new map of the world with the borders of 1947

# Roadmap

* New laws and policies to dictate the trajectory of your nation
* Events for landmark moments in history (e.g. the Cuban Missile Crisis)
* A world tension system resembling the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
* New production chains and resources
* New technologies to research
