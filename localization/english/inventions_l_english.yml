  ### Technology Tooltips
  ##joint_stock_companies: "Joint Stock Companies"
  ##joint_stock_companies_desc: "A joint stock company is one whose ownership is divided into a number of shares which are held unequally by many investors, who derive dividends from the company according to the size of the portion they own. This allows trading of partial ownership and investment by both rich and middle-class businessmen."
  ##lenders_of_last_resort: "Lenders of Last Resort"
  ##lenders_of_last_resort_desc: "State-owned central banks are large enough to come to the rescue of smaller commercial banks, such as during bank runs. This can prevent a financial crisis spreading to other sectors of the economy. Often, even the promise of rescue in times of difficulty is enough to prevent bank runs occurring in the first place. Some 'critics' claim that such a promise will encourage risky behavior by the commercial banks, but these 'critics' are surely just anarchists looking to wreck the nation's economic security, as bankers are some of the most trustworthy people to walk the halls of power."
  ##limited_liability: "Limited Liability"
  ##limited_liability_desc: "A limited liability company draws a legal distinction between the company and its owners. This helps prevent the bankruptcy of a company ruining the personal lives of the investors, as creditors will not try to haul off the furniture of failed businessmen to recoup losses. This makes investing less risky, if perhaps less satisfying to watch from afar. As a separate legal entity, the company has its own finances that must be audited and taxed."
  ##marketing_desc: "Promotional schemes to grab more market share or create a new market from scratch were devised by Josiah Wedgwood, leader of the expanding pottery industry at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution."
  ##paper_money: "Paper Money"
  ##paper_money_desc: "A kind of promissory note issued by a bank, paper money allows private citizens to move and exchange large volumes of currency without the danger and discomfit of gold or silver coins which cannot be divided and are heavy to carry. Thus, commercial exchanges are easier and safer."
  ##regulated_private_notes: "Regulated Private Notes"
  ##regulated_private_notes_desc: "Bankers realized hundreds of years ago that their customers only rarely demand back their deposits all at once. By issuing loans in excess of their reserves in the form of private bank notes, bankers could make even more money from interest. Unfortunately, when all the bank's customers do demand their deposits at once, there will not be enough reserves. With better communications technology, these 'bank runs' become more frequent. To prevent bank runs, governments can restrict the issuance of private notes only to banks that meet certain criteria of fiduciary responsibility, such as being close personal friends to the finance minister."
  #alcohol: "Alcohol"
  #alcohol_desc: "An ancient technology, presumably discovered when a tribesman left some grain in a puddle and decided to drink it after a few months had passed, alcohol became central to the discipline of alchemy, and continues to serve men of reason in the field of chemistry in various processes, some of which do not involve drinking it."
  #atomic_theory_of_matter: "Atomic Theory of Matter"
  #atomic_theory_of_matter_desc: "Observations in chemistry seem to have disproven the notion held by supporters of phlogiston that matter is composed of the three fundamental essences of solidity, fluidity and inflammability. Air is not merely a void into which phlogiston flows during combustion - it contains oxygen, which combines with other matter during chemical reactions."
  #bankruptcy_law: "Bankruptcy Law"

  #census: "Census"
  #census_desc: "Knowing how many people we have in our country and roughly were they live is important so we know where to spend out money and how many men we will have if we have to fight. Should we be involved in that grubby business of having our lower orders actually having representation I suppose it will have a use for that as well."
  #chemical_batteries: "Chemical Batteries"
  #chemical_batteries_desc: "Electricity can be generated by exploiting the difference in charge as electrolytes pass through oxidation and reduction cells containing copper and zinc cathodes and annodes. Early experiments in this field took the form of a series of jars which had the appearance of a battery of artillery, hence the name."
  #civil_service: "Civil Service"
  #civil_service_desc: "The idea that the government should have a body of men on which they rely on to carry out administration is neither new nor necessarily efficient. The radical idea that people should be selected for these positions on merit and ability and that they should keep their positions if the government is changed are radical and leads to greater efficiency."
  #clinical_thermometer: "Clinical Thermometer"
  #clinical_thermometer_desc: "The mercury thermometer had been around since the mid 18th century. Its use for medical purposes were limited as they tended to be large (over a foot long) and could take over 20 minutes to measure someone's temperature. Now we have made the thermometer smaller and it only takes a few minutes to get a reading, making it truly useful for doctors."
  #commercial_banks: "Commercial Banks"
  #commercial_banks_desc: "Businesses need various financial services to operate normally. Payroll at the end of the month might require a short loan to cover a temporary shortfall. Expanding the business might likewise require borrowing, especially if the business is a limited liability company rather than a personal venture. Commercial banks offer financial services to these companies, as opposed to wealthy private individuals, middle-class savers or professional investors."
  #cooperatives: "Co-Operatives"
  #cooperatives_desc: "Intended as a mutually beneficial organization to help small businesses and workers buy basic necessities, a co-operative tends to be run democratically by its members to achieve social good rather than pure profit."
  #credit_unions: "Credit Unions"
  #credit_unions_desc: "Rather than being operated for the profit of an owner or shareholders, credit unions are a financial institution which tries to improve the welfare of its members through access to credit. They tend to be run democratically, with each member having a vote on the director of the credit union."
  #customs_tariffs: "Customs Tariffs"
  #customs_tariffs_desc: "Tariffs are a very important weapon in a government's arsenal. They can be used both to raise revenue and to 'guide' merchants and businesses into making choices beneficial to the national interest, as determined by the government. Tariffs can be charged on entry into a country, for the use of port facilities, or on the price of imported or exported goods. One important use for tariffs is in protecting native industries against more efficient foreign companies, which can give domestic firms time to catch up with their rivals abroad."
  #department_stores: "Department Stores"
  #department_stores_desc: "Having one large store that sells a huge variety of goods can be more convenient for customers and gives the retailer more buying-power over the distribution chains."
  #distribution_channels: "Distribution Channels"
  #distribution_channels_desc: "Companies can be structured to sell goods in a number of ways. Raw materials are generally sold to other industries; industries might then sell manufactured goods to wholesalers such as brokers; wholesalers then sell goods to retailers such as specific shops or chains of shops, and the retailer then sells the goods to the final customer. Innovations in this area include factory or outlet stores, which sell goods directly to customers from the factory complex, such as to workers and their families and community."
  #enclosure_acts: "Enclosure Acts"
  #enclosure_acts_desc: "Enclosure is the process of taking small strips of peasant land, passed down from father to son since the beginning of feudalism, and 'combining' them under one owner via Acts of Parliament. By merging these subsistence plots into enclosed fields, arable land can be turned into pasture, capital goods such as machinery can be invested in, and many small surpluses can be merged into a significant profit. Where the landless informal_workers go is up to them - am I my brother's keeper?"
  #espionage: "Espionage"
  #espionage_desc: "Know thy enemy. Knowledge of what is going on in places that could be hostile to us is vital if we are going to keep out country safe. This can be in the form of the mundane, like ensuring proper maps exist of areas we may end up being at war in to the significant like enemy forces and plans."
  #gold_standard: "Gold Standard"
  #hereditary_aristocracy_desc: "As a society becomes more productive enough food can be generated to allow people to specialize and do things that do not require you to farm. A military caste to protect yourself from hostile neighbors is a natural development and eventually they will entrench their position and hereditary aristocracy is born."
  #insurance: "Insurance"
  #insurance_desc: "Insurance against loss of property has existed for many hundreds of years, being especially important for merchant vessels traveling overseas. As global trade becomes more prevalent, the need for more secure maritime insurance increases. Lloyd's of London began as a specialist for maritime insurance but has expanded into other markets such as insuring properties against fire damage."
  #malthusianism: "Malthusianism"
  #malthusianism_desc: "Population is increasing much faster than our food supply. We must face the fact that if we allow this to continue we will face a catastrophe for our people. Further more we must face the face any such catastrophe will hurt the lower classes the most. The Tory ideal of paternalism is not good nor noble but instead will lead to a greater catastrophe on the least fortunate."
  #manifest_destiny: "Manifest Destiny"
  #manifest_destiny_desc: "If we are to spread our civilization to those less fortunate to have we must accept the fact that we have been uniquely blessed with virtues and institutions that others simply do not have. We have a mission to redeem the less fortunate by remaking them in our own image. It is no more that our destiny to do this."
  #oceanic_cablelaying: "Oceanic Cablelaying"
  #oceanic_cablelaying_desc: "With the technology of the telegraph, thought soon turned to how to lay a cable under bodies of water. Although it proved not technically difficult to lay cables of short stretches of water (like bays and straits), the wide oceans proved a greater challenge. Good news - after several false starts we have successfully mastered the techniques to lay such a cable so no longer must we rely on the good will of others."
  #ophthalmoscope: "Opthalmoscope"
  #ophthalmoscope_desc: "'every eye could be made luminous if the axis from a source of illumination directed towards a person's eye and the line of vision of the observer were coincident', this discovery revolutionized the treatment of eye problems. Creating a hand held device with a mirror that could shine the light, the ophthalmoscope, was made the doctor's life a lot easier."
  #positivism: "Positivism"
  #positivism_desc: "We we consider what knowledge is we know that there is certain knowledge. Information that comes from sensory experience and  then interpretation comes through logic and reason is the exclusive source of certain knowledge. We can extend this from the physical world to societies as a whole. Societies operate under general laws which if we took the time to analyze we would understand. Theology must be rejected because faith by its very nature denies reason and verification."
  #postal_banks: "Postal Banks"
  #postal_banks_desc: "Rural and otherwise isolated communities may not have access to a local bank branch. In such cases, a postal bank can operate to offer them financial services, such as savings and a current account, without the need to travel into a town or city."
