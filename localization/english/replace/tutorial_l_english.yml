Perhaps you can sustain your [Concept('concept_pop','$concept_pops$')] with simple farming and cottage industries for some time, and perhaps you have access to a valuable resource or two you can focus your industry around, but an industrializing nation will find before long that certain [Concept('concept_good','$concept_goods$')] are just not available in sufficient quantities at home.\n\nIt is similarly possible to run out of demand for the $concept_goods$ you are able to produce in excess. Exporting these $concept_goods$ to [Concept('concept_market','$concept_markets$')] that need them can provide your producers with higher [Concept('concept_building_wage','$concept_building_wages$')], profit for employees of your [GetBuildingType('building_trade_center').GetName]s, and even export [concept_tariffs] for your [concept_treasury].
