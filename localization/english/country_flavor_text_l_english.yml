  # Europe
 GBR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "While Britain still holds on to its empire, that hold is slipping. With the Statute of Westminster, the dominions have become effectively sovereign, and elsewhere independence movements are gaining steam. Large debts to the Americans still need to be paid, and the economy still suffers under rationing. The Sun may very well set on the British Empire soon."
 FRA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "France did not have an easy time with the Second World War. Now liberated the nation is still in tatters and greatly divided. Much work will need to be done to reestablish French prestige, and stability is of no guarantee. The colonies rightfully resent French rule, and France may no longer have the resources to hold onto them forever."
 SPA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Spain stands as one of the last few countries where fascism was not overthrown at the end of a gun. While strongly on the right and deeply anticommunistic it unwillingness to support the axis has left it less of a pariah than simply isolationist. How will Spain move towards the future? Will the Francoists fall and democracy return or is the fate of the Spanish to be one of dictatorship?"
 ITA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Italy is unique amongst the former Axis powers. Having overthrown Mussolini and the fascists during the war, it stands as the only former member of the axis not occupied or partitioned. Republicanism has become extremely popular and the population has become split ideologically. In what direction will Italy go? To the West and with its liberators? To the East with its communist movement? Only time will tell."
 YUG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Yugoslavia is a unique state in Europe. A communist state, but one liberated on their own terms. A federation of the South Slavs despite their own crimes against each other only years prior. Will Yugoslavia prove itself with its own path to communism or will it fall to the very same infighting that the kingdom was gripped in only years ago? "
 
 EUROPE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Europe has found itself devastated following WW2. Almost every state found itself drawn into the conflict on one side or another and all of the region needs time to rebuild and recover. How will Europe define itself in this new world? Will it unify or find itself split between the two blocs? What lessons will be learnt by those as the frontlines of this new conflict?"

Having lost the war and committed a litany of crimes against humanity while the Nazi's ruled it will likely be years before German sovereignty is restored. How will Germany emerge from this period? Will it return to international relevance or will it remain a divided borderland forevermore?"

With the Nazi menace defeated swathes of Eastern Europe now stand under Soviet influence while the Soviet Union stands ready as the face of international communism and as the world's second superpower. Success should not breed arrogance however; The economy and population was devastated during the war, and while the Eastern Bloc provides a useful buffer, revolution at the point of a foreign gun may provide future antagonisms."
 EASTBLOC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Eastern bloc represents the first growth of communism abroad, alongside that of Mao's ongoing struggle in China. Imposed from the top down and not yet fully established, how will eastern Europe face the future? Will they rebel against their Soviet overlords or fight alongside them as fraternal brothers of socialism? Will they forever be mere puppets and military administrations or sovereign states in their own right?"

  # East Asia
 JAP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Japan is a nation broken by the Second World War. Nuked twice and with its colonial empire in tatters the nation will need to radically reform to survive. American occupation intends to bring democracy and rule of law, but how will the Japanese plot their way forwards? The destruction of the militarists leaves great potential for change but who will seize upon this power vacuum and to what end?"
 PRC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "From their betrayal at the hands of the Kuomintang to the long march and guerilla war in Yan'an the CPC has not had an easy time. Now finally on the upswing will the CPC bring liberation to the Chinese people and bring a definitive end to the warlord era? Or will will this army marching with only hope, millet and rifles find itself defeated against the forces of the Nationalists?"
 ROC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Republic of China is not in good straits. Between tens of millions of lives lost in WW2, the newly restarted civil war or the general incompetence and corruption of the Kuomintang regime the future looks bleak despite victory against Japan. Will  Chiang claim his final victory against Mao or will the ROC collapse or be exiled to Taiwan? Will the precepts of Sun Yat Sen be followed or abandoned?"
 
 KOREA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Korea stands divided and split as a frontline between the two new blocs. In the North former Korean members of the CPC have largely seized power under Soviet occupation while in the South the Americans look to put their own president in power. Will detente prevail and Korea be united in peace or will the peninsula be divided in war?"

 HND_FLAVOR_TEXT: "India stands at the brink of independence, but with a movement that largely does not agree how that independence will be implemented. Whether the Indian subcontinent will be split along religious or political lines has not yet been fully determined. Once the British have left such decisions will fall to the Indian people."
 INDUS_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Indian subcontinent is changing rapidly. With the growing success of the independence movement in India the ideals of republicanism, nationalism and socialism have shaken the region to its core but ethnic and religious disputes remain the greatest dividing lines in the subcontinent. What fate will these Presidents and Princes set for the region?"

 VNM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Vietnam has had a troubled history during the reign of the Nguyen dynasty, as it was slowly conquered by the French. However with the abdication of Bao Dai in 1945, and the rise of the Viet Minh in the north the nation seems set to ride a far different path. Will the North reunite the country under communism? Or shall the south find itself uniting the country as an ally of the west? Only time will tell, though a war of some kind seems likely should the French hold any pretenses of colonial authority."
 IDS_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Indonesia has long been under the Dutch boot, yet with the effective collapse of Dutch rule during the war, independence seems a foregone conclusion. Deeply divided along ethnic, religious and political lines, independence seems the one area most Indonesians can agree on. Whether the nationalists, communists or perhaps even the liberals find themselves triumphant, breaking away from the dutch must happen first." 
 THA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "One of the few countries in east asia to never be conquered by the imperial powers, Thailand sits in a peculiar position. Only having embraced a constitution in the 30's the country seems set to struggle between the autocracy of the king and the various new social movements this century has already brought."
 SOUTHASIA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Southeast Asia found itself near totally colonized in the 19th century, and near totally occupied by the Japanese only years ago. The region is rich in rubber, oil and other goods, but until now little of that industry has found its way into local coffers, and even less into their native inhabitants' hands. In the newly approaching era of decolonization and political struggle, independence is a likely event, though in what direction the region may lean is one with little certainty. "

 AST_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Australia and New Zealand proved themselves well in both of the world wars, and still yet benefit from British suzerainty.

Britain looks to be weakening while the Americans now stride on the world stage, while the USSR merely menaces across the artic. How will Canada decide its fate in this new era?"
 MEX_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Mexico stands in a bizarre place in the post war world. For the first time in quite the long time relative peace has gripped the country. While the PRI still holds on to its one party rule, increasingly good relations with the USA and significant economic and political reforms have granted the country real stability. Will Mexico finally find itself free of the constant conflict it has been mired in, or is it a meer break from the norm?"
 USA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "In the West the United States stands triumphant. Bearing the largest economy and one of the strongest militaries, America is ready and willing to take its position as the foremost superpower of the world. Success should not breed arrogance however: unequal civil rights remain an issue internally and the nascent Western Bloc is vast and distant."
 
  # Caribbean
 CARRIBEAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Caribbean is a region largely new to independence, and much of it still remains under the crown of various european powers.

 ETH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Ethiopia, while crippled by the Italian conquest, stands tall with the Second World War over. While the British used their liberation of the country as a way to continue their pilfering of the continent, a possible federation with Eritrea and the concrete sovereignty of the state leaves Ethiopia in a better state than most in the continent."
 SAF_FLAVOR_TEXT: "South Africa is a nation defined by its conquests. From the brutality of segregation to the two contrasting colonial settler groups of the Boers and Brit's the dominion has one of the longest histories of any European colonies in Africa. Deeply unequal though richer than most countries on the continent, how will South Africa change in the future? "
 AFRICA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Africa's fate in the 20th century has not yet been kind but the future looks bright. The rise of two new superpowers able and willing to support independence movements alongside the decline of the colonizers has brought new life to independence movements.

  # Middle-East
 EGY_FLAVOR_TEXT: "While in some form civilization has prospered in Egypt for more than five thousand years, in the modern day its influence has fallen far. While already independent, the loss of the Suez has deprived the country of a key route of funding, and general underdevelopment since the days of the Khedivate still persists. The King remains somewhat unpopular and the nation may very well go in any number of directions."
 NEJ_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Saudi dynasty stands the strongest it has ever been in the aftermath of the second world war. With the discovery of vast oil reserves in recent years and extensive work with the USA to tap into them, Saudi Arabia may very well find itself amongst the richest nations in the middle east, so long as it ensures its own profit over this production."
 TUR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Turkey has reinvented itself since Ottoman times. Under the guiding hand of Ataturk the nation has found itself stabilized, bearing a well set upon neutral foreign policy. A turn to the West or East however may be prudent, and to aid either bloc through the holding of the Bosphorus may prove fruitful."
 PER_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Iran like many nations in the middle east has not had an easy time in the 20th century as of yet. While not directly colonized, foreign ownership over their oil production has left the nation deeply exploited by the British, a situation only worsened by the invasion and effective occupation of Iran during the war. Already attacked by both west and east, will Iran try to move on its own path?"

Whether it shall become united in unity or a battleground of ideology remains yet to be seen."
