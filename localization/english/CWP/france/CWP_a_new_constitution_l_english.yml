  fra_a_new_constitution_reason: "$fra_a_new_constitution_breakdown$ \n\nFrance is penning a new constitution. Its political parties have reached a consensus in rationalizing the parliamentary system to avoid instability within the Republic, but it remains uncertain which shape a future Republic may take.\n\nCharles de Gaulle argues that the parliamentary system will undoubtedly lead to a 'régime des partis,' a regime of the parties, repeating the errors of the Third Republic — many of which could have been avoided by maintaining a strong executive branch. Meanwhile, the $ig_variant_laborists$ and $ig_variant_urbanists$ believe that political stability will only exist through a supreme National Assembly. $ig_variant_moralists$, aligned with de Gaulle, can accept the parliamentary form of government, though they insist on counter-powers akin to the Senate of the Third Republic."

When the time for Liberation came, those who were ostracized and marginalized for their part in the Resistance went as far as executing those who had collaborated with Philippe Pétain and Adolf Hitler, leaving the political landscape dominated by insurgents."
