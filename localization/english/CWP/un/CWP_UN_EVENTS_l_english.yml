  # Resolution on Korea passed
  un_resolution_events.5.t: "Proposal for #t Unified elections in Korea #! #p Passed"
  un_resolution_events.5.d: "The United Nations general assembly has just passed the resolution today calling for the formation of a UN commission to oversee unification and elections on the korean peninsula. The power of the commission however is dependent on the practical cooperation of the administration zones, should either zone refuse to cooperate with the UN commission the holding of nation wide elections will become impossible. Even if the resolution is non-binding the pressure to resolve the issue of korea has been increased markedly"
  un_resolution_events.5.f: "Today the general assembly of the united nations have passed a resolution pertaining to the ongoing situation in korea. The resolution forms the United Nations Temporary Committee on Korea who's mandate is to oversee the unification of the American and Soviet administrative zones along with monitoring elections across the entire country. Although the committee's mandate seems firm the the achievement of their goals depends on the cooperation of the administrations and their backers. Neither side has yet to make firm commitments to cooperating on the goal of unification or even adhering to the resolution so time shall tell if anything shall come of this international mandate...

  un_resolution_events.6.f: "News from the United Nations today as a proposal to mandate unified elections in korea has been struck down by a vote in the general assembly. Unification activists from korea and moderates are particularly disappointed with the outcome of the vote as their hopes for a peacefully unified korea have been dashed. Despite the result neither korean administration shows signs of backing down on their claim to being the rightful government of korea with confidential sources from the diplomatic sphere suggesting that the US and the USSR are planning to go ahead with plans to establish allied states in their respective zones of control each likely to claim sole legitimacy of the government of korea. Only one thing is certain, Korea shall not be unified via peaceful means anytime soon... The Washington Post"
