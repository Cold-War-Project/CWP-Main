  west_german_unification.1.d: "As the leaders of the United States, France, and Great Britain gathered to discuss the potential re-unification of West Germany, they were acutely aware of the hardships that came with maintaining the military occupation zones. The physical and emotional toll on their troops was immense, and the logistical challenges were formidable.\n\nThey knew that time was of the essence, and that a decisive plan needed to finally be put in place before the situation grew more complex and dangerous. As they debated various proposals and weighed the consequences of each, they were mindful of the risks involved and the potential impact on the world stage.

Each option had its own risks and benefits, and it was up to the three powers to weigh them carefully."
  west_german_unification.101.f: "Despite the challenges, the United States, France, and Great Britain remained committed to finding a solution that would be in the best interests of the Austrian people and the broader geopolitical landscape of Europe.\n\nAs the vote drew to a close, tensions ran high, and the outcome was..."
