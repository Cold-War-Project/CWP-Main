The United States, Great Britain, and France controlled the western part of Germany, and after many years of occupation, more and more questions about a potential re-unification start arising..."

  west_german_unification.1.d: "As the leaders of the United States, France, and Great Britain gathered to discuss the potential re-unification of West Germany, they were acutely aware of the hardships that came with maintaining the military occupation zones. The physical and emotional toll on their troops was immense, and the logistical challenges were formidable.\n\nThey knew that time was of the essence, and that a decisive plan needed to finally be put in place before the situation grew more complex and dangerous. As they debated various proposals and weighed the consequences of each, they were mindful of the risks involved and the potential impact on the world stage.

  west_german_unification.10.d: "The question of highly intelligent Nazi scientists, engineers, and technicians has long been a subject of controversy and debate.

As tensions remained high, the three powers were faced with a difficult decision.\n\nThree options are on the table: re-uniting Austria with the Soviet-occupied part, re-uniting Austria without the Soviet part, or reforming Austria into the Danube Federation. Each option had its own risks and benefits, and it was up to the three powers to weigh them carefully."
  west_german_unification.101.f: "Despite the challenges, the United States, France, and Great Britain remained committed to finding a solution that would be in the best interests of the Austrian people and the broader geopolitical landscape of Europe.\n\nAs the vote drew to a close, tensions ran high, and the outcome was..."

A vote has been called to determine the best course of action, with three options on the table.\n\nThe first is to deploy the Morgenthau plan, which would lead to the complete dismantling and de-industrialization of Germany. The second option is to proceed with moderate de-nazification, which would aim to remove high-ranking Nazis and their influence from government and public life. The third and final option is to not de-nazify at all, leaving the remnants of the Nazi regime intact. "
  west_german_unification.102.f: "The leaders must come to a decision on how to proceed, knowing that the fate of Germany and the world rests in their hands, and their decision would be to..."
