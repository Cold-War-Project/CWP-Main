  united_kingdom_post_war_rationing: "Rationing"
  united_kingdom_post_war_rationing_reason: "With the end of World War 2, Britain finds herself in a precarious position. America has unilaterally ended Lend-Lease with Japan's surrender; leaving us with a potential crisis if we don't ensure control of the food supply for the near future. We will have to continue rationing... a decision that will be greatly disliked by the public after having just won the war."
  
  UK_ADDED_INF: "Added inflation from uncontrolled market demamd"
