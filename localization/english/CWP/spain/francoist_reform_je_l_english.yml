democracia_organica.t: "Demoracia Orgánica"
democracia_organica.d: "The organic conception of society dates back to the Stoics, while its foremost theorist was Althusius. In the Contemporary Age, German idealism, with figures like Hegel and lesser-known thinkers like Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, embraced this idea. Krause's disciple, Heinrich Ahrens, systematically developed it and became one of the most dedicated proponents of Krausist philosophy. In contrast to liberal democracies, organic democracy considered that instead of the criticized political parties, the natural organs of association were three: the family, where one is born; the municipality, where one lives; the trade union, where one works."

democracia_organica.b: "We must turn to FET y de las JONS (Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista) as our state-party."
democracia_organica.c: "We are a democracy in our way."
democracia_organica.e: "We will use the Democracia Orgánica to legitimize ourselves as an alternative to liberal democracy. A step for guaranteeing that we distance ourselves from fascism."
