democracia_organica.f: "The organic conception of society dates back to the stoics. While its foremost theorist was Althusius, in the Contemporary Age figureheads such as Hegel and lesser-known thinkers like Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, embraced this political thought. Krause's disciple, Heinrich Ahrens systematically developed it and became one of the most dedicated proponents of Krausist philosophy. In contrast to liberal democracies, organic democracy considered that instead of oft criticized political parties, the natural organs of association were three: the family, where one is born; the municipality, where one lives; and the trade union, where one works."
