korean_un_unification.1.t: "Korean Unification Elections"
korean_un_unification.1.d: "With the passing of UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying Korea under a single government. For Korean unification to go ahead it would require the acceptance of us, South Korea, the Soviets and the North Koreans in that order. To make the proposed elections more agreeable to the Soviets we shall communicate that a unified Korean government would be neutral on the world stage."
korean_un_unification.1.f: "Proposed mandate for Korean Unification.\n\n1. Establishment of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea.\n\n2. The holding of free and fair elections throughout the entirety of the Peninsula.\n\n3. The Withdrawal of US and Soviet military forces from the Peninsula.\n\n4. The creation of a Korean constitution drafted by the Korean government in cooperation of the UNTCK\n\nAdditional note: Any unified Korean government will agree to geopolitical neutrality in matters relating to the USA and USSR in return, both powers will maintain a policy of non-intervention."
korean_un_unification.1.a: "Agree to the elections and pass it on to the South Koreans."
korean_un_unification.1.b: "We can't afford to lose our position on the peninsula."

korean_un_unification.2.t: "Korean Unification Elections"
korean_un_unification.2.d: "With the passing of the UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying Korea under a single government. For the unification and elections to go ahead we would have to get the agreement of the Soviets and the administration in the North. The Americans have given their support to this proposal but the decision to allow the UNTCK into the country rests with our administration. A Unified Korea would be a democratic state with free elections but conditions of the unification would allow communist participation in politics and we would be forced to abandon American backing in favour of neutrality. If we agree the proposal shall be passed onto the Soviets and the Northern administration."

korean_un_unification.3.t: "Korean Unification Elections"
korean_un_unification.3.d: "With the passing of the UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying Korea under a single government. The US and the administration in the South have agreed to allow these elections to take place but if we refuse to agree to allow the UN into our zone unified elections can't be held. A Unified Korea would be a democratic state with free and fair elections but we would be allowed to participate politically and with support could eventually gain control of the whole state via peaceful means. Though the Americans could also try a similar trick so this option would not be without risk. If we agree the proposal would be passed onto the administration in our sector in Korea for final validation, though it is unlikely they would go against our directive."

korean_un_unification.4.t: "Korean Unification Elections"
korean_un_unification.4.d: "With the passing of the UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying Korea under a single government. In a surprise turn of events the Soviets have agreed to holding unified Korean elections. Although the Soviets have instructed us to agree, our local administration could still block UN election monitors from entering the North effectively scuppering the UN mandated unification plans, allowing us to form a government on our own terms. If we agree to those elections the party will be allowed to participate in the elections but along democratic lines of which we have no guarantee to win. It would greatly hurt our relations with Moscow if we block the elections but it will guarantee the sovereignty of our government."

Though not officially said yet this has effectively signaled the death of any attempt to unify Korea via peaceful means."
korean_un_unification.6.f: "As the diplomatic teams pack up and leave, some angry, others frustrated and many saddened by the outcome of events, all know that this is not the end. Neither side is willing to back down on the subject of Korean independence as whether they like it or not the question of unification shall no longer be resolved with meetings and diplomacy but with blood and iron."
