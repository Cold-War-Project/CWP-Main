#South Korea Formation
korean_formation.1.t: "Foundation of the Republic of Korea"
korean_formation.1.d: "Today marks the foundation of the Republic of Korea as the US Military governor hands over authority to the civilian government at a ceremony in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] watched by thousands of citizens and the press. It is unlikely the North shall take this declaration lying down, so we must be prepared for the worst."
korean_formation.1.f: "The atmosphere at the ceremony was intoxicating. People cheered and celebrated, there was not a single person not caught in the moment. Though despite the jubilation of the moment a lingering feeling of unease permeated the air; I think everyone on some level was thinking about the implications of only half of korea declaring independence. We wondered how long it would be until similar ceremonies were held in Pyongyang. Could they coexist? Would there be war? it was these feelings of unease that spoiled what would be an otherwise joyous occasion. -Yi Kyung-"
korean_formation.1.a: "Korea has Returned, but not as a whole"
#North Korea Formation
korean_formation.2.t: "Founding of the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea"
korean_formation.2.d: "A vast military parade in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] signaled the founding of the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea as the Soviet administration hands authority over to the government of the Workers Party of Korea. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [GetPlayer.GetRuler.GetFullName] has marked the occasion with a rousing speech celebrating the revolutionary origins of this new nation. The founding of a rival nation has likely set of alarm bells in Seoul as it becomes increasingly clear that coexistence is rapidly becoming impossible."
korean_formation.2.f: "I, and the other Soviet officers watched with a sense of pride, the kind one feels seeing a beloved son graduate from university. We had watched these brave men and women fighting like bears since those cold days in the bleak hills of Manchuria. It was because of this pride I, and probably many others; allowed the tears to flow without shame for the first time in my life. -Major Aleksandr Averyanov-"
korean_formation.2.a: "The revolution marches in North Korea, but will it march South?"
