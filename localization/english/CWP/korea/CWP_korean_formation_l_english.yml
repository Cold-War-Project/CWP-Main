#South Korea Formation
korean_formation.1.t: "Foundation of the Republic of Korea"
korean_formation.1.d: "Today marks the foundation of the Republic of Korea as the US Military governor hands over authority to the civilian government at a ceremony in Seoul watched by thousands of citizens and the press. President [GetPlayer.GetRuler.GetFullName] concluded the event with a speech in which it was declared that today marks the foundation of the republic of all Korea signaling a move towards a policy of unification. It is unlikely the north shall take this declaration lying down and we must be prepared for the worst."
korean_formation.1.f: "The atmosphere at the ceremony was intoxicating, you truly felt like you were witnessing something historic. People cheered and celebrated, there was not a single person not caught in the moment. Though despite the jubilation of the moment a lingering feeling of unease permeated the air, one that had nothing to do with the sinister presence of the same police that enforced Japan's rule; I think everyone on some level was thinking about the implications of only half of korea declaring independence. We wondered how long it would be until similar ceremonies were held in Pyongyang and what would happen after that and that a communist rival to our national project would exist. Could they coexist? would there be war? it was these feelings of unease that spoiled what would be an otherwise joyous occasion. -Yi Kyung, South Korean Citizen in an interview 1965-"
korean_formation.1.a: "Korea has Returned, but not as a whole"

korean_formation.2.t: "Founding of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea"
korean_formation.2.d: "A vast military parade in pyongyang signaled the founding of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea as the soviet administration hands authority over to the government of the Workers Party of Korea. Chairman [GetPlayer.GetRuler.GetFullName] has handed marked the occasion with a rousing speech celebrating the revolutionary origins of this new nation and the transferal of that struggle towards the full unification of Korea as a nation vowing that the revolution is not complete until Korea is unified under socialism. The founding of a rival nation and the inflammatory speech from the chairman has likely set of alarm bells in Seoul as it becomes increasingly clear to both sides that coexistence is rapidly becoming impossible."
korean_formation.2.f: "I and the other soviet officers watched the parade with a sense of pride, the kind one feels seeing a beloved son graduate from university. We had watched these brave men and women fighting like bears since those cold days in the bleak hills of manchuria. When we first met them they were partisans with a resolve of steel but lacking the experience of a veteran movement, now they march through pyongyang not just as partisans but as servicemembers and liberators. I had no doubt that they would carry the cause of revolution steadfastly beyond this cold parade ground in pyongyang to beyond, to a red korea and a red world. It was because of this pride I, and probably many others their; allowed the tears to flow without shame for the first time in my life. -Major Aleksandr Averyanov's diary on the day of the founding of the DPRK-"
