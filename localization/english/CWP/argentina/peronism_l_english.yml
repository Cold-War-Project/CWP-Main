franco_peron_event.1.t: "Franco-Perón Protocols"
franco_peron_event.1.d: "The possibility of Argentina's Peronist government assisting the isolated Spain by sending grain and other agricultural products involves a multifaceted consideration of diplomatic, economic, and political factors. This assistance could strengthen diplomatic ties, generate revenue for Argentina's economy, and stimulate its agricultural sector. However, it would probably anger the USA as Spain's political situation is not seen with good eyes, making it a complex decision requiring careful consideration."
franco_peron_event.1.f: "Maybe Franco is the demonstration of a political third-way."
franco_peron_event.1.a: "Let's send the help."
franco_peron_event.2.a: "We should take care of ourselves."
