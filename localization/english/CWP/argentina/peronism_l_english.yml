franco_peron_event.1.t: "The Franco-Perón Protocol"
franco_peron_event.1.d: "Following years of wartime, Spain is in need of our help. Perhaps it's time we extend an olive branch to our homeland and their powerful leader."
franco_peron_event.1.f: "Involving a multifaceted scheme of diplomatic, economic and political considerations, Argentina's Perónist government decides whether or not to assist an isolated Spain by way of agricultural aid. This assistance could strengthen diplomatic ties, generate revenue for Argentina's economy, and stimulate its agricultural sector. However, given Franco's political perception, drifting from their sphere will anger the US. A complex decision faces Perón's government."
franco_peron_event.1.a: "Let's send them aid."
franco_peron_event.2.a: "We should take care of ourselves."
