  MENU_MESSAGE: "#t Welcome to the Cold War Project Alpha!\n\nWe are working hard to make this mod as good as possible, and we hope you will enjoy it!\n\nWhile we profoundly appreciate your willingness to test the game at such an early stage, be wary. This is a very early version of the mod, and as such, there may be bugs and missing features.\n\nExpect a lot of changes rolling out each month (hopefully) that will break your saves.\n\nFinally, it is your duty as an alpha tester to report any bugs you find, and to give us feedback on the mod.\n\nThanks so much for your help and dedication, we truly could not be doing this without your support! #!"
