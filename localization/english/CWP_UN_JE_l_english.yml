  je_declaration_of_human_rights_goal: "UN Voting has Concluded"
  je_declaration_of_human_rights_reason: "#t The United Nations Proclaims\n#!I stand before you today to propose a declaration of universal human rights that would establish a common standard of human dignity and worth that transcends borders and cultures. The time has come for the international community to declare that all human beings are entitled to fundamental rights and freedoms, simply by virtue of being human.\n \n At the core of this declaration would be the recognition of the inherent dignity and worth of every human being. This recognition would be the foundation upon which all other rights and freedoms are built. We must declare that every person has the right to life, liberty, and security of person, as well as freedom from discrimination and arbitrary detention.\n \n Other rights that must be included in this declaration would be the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, as well as the right to freedom of expression and assembly. Additionally, we must declare that all individuals have the right to fair and equal treatment before the law, as well as the right to participate in the political process and have access to education and healthcare.\n \nI firmly believe that the international community is up to the task of overcoming these challenges and making a powerful statement about the inherent worth of every human being.\n \nI urge all member states to join me in supporting the adoption of a declaration of universal human rights. Let us stand together in solidarity with all those who have fought for human rights throughout history and make a commitment to a brighter, more just future for all. Thank you.#!"
