 korean_un_unification.1.d:0 "With the passing of UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying korea under a single government. in spite of the UN requesting to hold UN monitored elections in both the north and the south whether or not these go ahead are dependent on the local governments and their international backers. For korean unification to go ahead it would require the acceptance of us, South Korea, the Soviets and the North Koreans in that order. It is unlikely the south korean's would disagree if we pass give our agreement but the real challenge is the north koreans and the Soviets. To make the proposed elections more agreeable to the Soviets we shall communicate that a unified korean government would be neutral on the world stage (though whether or not we hold to that is another matter.)"
 korean_un_unification.1.f:0 "Proposed mandate for Korean Unification.1. Establishment of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea.2. The holding of free and fair elections throughout the entirety of the Peninsula. 3. The Withdrawal of US and Soviet military forces from the Peninsula.4. The creation of a Korean constitution drafted by the korean government in cooperation of the UNTCK Additional note Any unified korean government will agree to geopolitical neutrality in matters relating to the USA and USSR in return, both powers will maintain a policy of non intervention."

 korean_un_unification.2.d:0 "With the passing of the UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying korea under a single government. For the unification and elections to go ahead we would have to get the agreement of the Soviets and the administration in the north. The Americans have given their support to this proposal but the decision to allow the UNTCK into the country rests with our administration. A Unified korea would be a democratic state with free elections but conditions of the unification would allow communist participation in politics and we would be forced to abandon American backing in favour of neutrality. If we agree the proposal shall be passed onto the Soviets and the northern administration."

 korean_un_unification.3.d:0 "With the passing of the UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying korea under a single government. The US and the administration in the south have agreed to allow these elections to take place but if we refuse to agree to allow the UN into our zone unified elections can't be held. A Unified korea would be a democratic state with free and fair elections but the communists would be allowed to participate politically and with support could eventually gain control of the whole state via peaceful means. Though the americans could also try a similar trick so this option would not be without risk. If we agree the proposal would be passed on to the administration in our sector in korea for final validation though it is unlikely they would go against our directive."

 korean_un_unification.4.d:0 "With the passing of the UN Resolution on Korean Reunification, an international mandate has been set for unifying korea under a single government. In a surprise turn of events the Soviets have agreed to holding unified korean elections in agreement with the Soviets. Although the Soviets have instructed us to agree, our local administration could still block UN election monitors from entering the north effectively scuppering the UN mandated unification plans allowing us to form a government in the north on our own terms. If we agree to those elections the party will be allowed to participate in the elections but along democratic lines of which we have no guarantee to win. It would greatly hurt our relations with Moscow if we block the elections but it will guarantee the sovereignty of our government."

 korean_un_unification.5.d:0 "Against the odds diplomacy has prevailed over geopolitical interest. The US, Soviets and northern administration have agreed to unify the administrations and hold nation-wide elections. Both us and the soviet administration have agreed to hand over authority to a UN monitored transitional authority until elections can be held. Though the elections are yet to be held this agreement marks the beginning of a unified korean nation."
 korean_un_unification.5.f:0 "Even as the parties on either side start to draw up plans to make their gains in the election and shape the new country in their image. Even as political battle lines are being drawn the people rejoice. The ideological lines and foreign machinations that threatened to destroy Korea's new chance at existence have receded. From intellectuals in the south to communist partisans in the north a feeling of unity has blossomed despite their differences as they join hands in union as after over 35 years a new feeling blossoms..."

 korean_un_unification.6.d:0 "Plans to merge the two administrative zones in Korea have collapse today as talks between the interested parties ground to a halt leading to a deadlock where elections would be unable to be carried out. Though not officially said yet this has effectively signaled the death of any attempt to unify Korea via peaceful means as reports come in that both the US and Soviets and making moves to found allied states within their respective occupation zones who will likely attempt to claim sole legitimacy."
 korean_un_unification.6.f:0 "As the diplomatic teams pack up and leave, some angry, others frustrated and many saddened by the outcome of events all know that this is not the end. Neither side is willing to back down on the subject of korean independence as whether they like it or not the question of unification shall no longer be resolved with meetings and diplomacy but with blood and iron."

The Americans and Soviets have also agreed to withdraw their forces from the peninsula and respect the authority of the UN mandate."
 korean_un_unification.7.f:0 "News from east asia today as after over 35 years the Korean nation has risen from the pages of history. After intense negotiation both sides of the 38th parallel both sides have managed come to an near impossible agreement to set aside their differences as unite as one. From an international perspective both the Americans and the Soviets have tentatively agreed to disengage from intervening in the affairs of this new Korea nominally declaring it as a neutral country, whether they stick to this is yet to be seen. As the last foreign forces withdraw from the peninsula, koreans from Busan to Pyongyang and beyond the streets are filled with people embracing each other and overwhelmed by the excitement and joy that the 35 years of wait are over and now they can proudly call themselves korean once more together as one. Whether they are Liberals, Nationalists, Communists or Socialists all have for today at least forgotten their differences and united as Koreans at last."
