 fra_a_new_constitution_reason:0 "$fra_a_new_constitution_breakdown$ \n\nFrance is penning a new constitution. Its political parties have reached a consensus in rationalizing the parliamentary system to avoid instability within the Republic, but it remains uncertain which shape a future Republic may take.\n\nCharles de Gaulle argues that the parliamentary system will undoubtedly lead to a 'régime des partis,' a regime of the parties, repeating the errors of the Third Republic — many of which could have been avoided by maintaining a strong executive branch. Meanwhile, the $ig_variant_laborists$ and $ig_variant_urbanists$ believe that political stability will only exist through a supreme National Assembly. $ig_variant_moralists$, aligned with de Gaulle, can accept the parliamentary form of government, though they insist on counter-powers akin to the Senate of the Third Republic."
