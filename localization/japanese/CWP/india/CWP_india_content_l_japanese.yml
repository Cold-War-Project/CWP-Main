 indian_partition_reason:0 "The Crown Jewel of the British Empire, the Raj, has been promised her freedom. The coming months will determine the nature of the partition and the relationship between the newly free Indian state and her former Suzerain. High National Unity will cause more princely states to join India, once formed.  At levels below 100, Pakistan may also form from the non-Hindi states of the former Raj. At low levels of national unity, some princely states will remain independent after the partition. \n\nThe relationship between Great Britain and India during the partition will determine what ties they will have after independence, if any at all."
