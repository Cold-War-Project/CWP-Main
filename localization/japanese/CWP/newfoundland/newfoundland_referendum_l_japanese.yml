 newfoundland_referendum:0 "Fate of Newfoundland"
 newfoundland_referendum_reason:0 "After World War II, Newfoundland was in a precarious financial situation. The war had depleted its resources and left the country deeply in debt. Additionally, it had been under the direct governance of the UK through the Commission of Government since 1934, due to the economic crisis during the Great Depression. Therefore, once the war ended, it was crucial to decide Newfoundland's future status - whether it would continue as a British dominion, return to self-governance, join Canada, or perhaps choose an independent future - to restore its economic and political stability. The decision could not be delayed because of the urgent need to address its economic challenges and chart a clear path for its future."
