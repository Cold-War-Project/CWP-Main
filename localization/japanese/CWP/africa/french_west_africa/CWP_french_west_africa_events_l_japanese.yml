 french_west_africa_events.1.d:0 "The year is 1946 and as France begins to rebuild, talks of building a new French Constitution has begun. Amadou Lamine-Guèye, has been invited to the French National Assembly to discuss the future of the French Republic. It's time to decide the fate of France's West African Colonies."
 french_west_africa_events.1.f:0 "The road ahead is long and difficult, and varying interests in West and central Africa will make it difficult to reach a consensus. Various factions within the French government will try to influence the outcome of the talks. The most important decision will be whether to grant independence to the colonies or to keep them as part of the French Republic. On some level, it may be prudent to remain under the thumb of the French Empire just a little longer to ensure that the colonies are not left to the whims of the global economy. On the other hand, the French Empire is in a state of decline and the colonies may be better off on their own."
