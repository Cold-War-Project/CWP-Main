The resolution forms the United Nations Temporary Committee on Korea who's mandate is to oversee the unification of the American and Soviet administrative zones along with monitoring elections across the entire country. Although the committee's mandate seems firm the the achievement of their goals depends on the cooperation of the administrations and their backers. Neither side has yet to make firm commitments to cooperating on the goal of unification or even adhering to the resolution so time shall tell if anything shall come of this international mandate...
