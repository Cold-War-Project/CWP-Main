# A battle condition is something that is added to one side of a battle when the
# battle begins. Each side gets its own independent condition, which is randomly
# rolled but is based on external condition such as the traits of the commander
# in charge, the terrain of the province tha battle is being fought in, and so
# on.
#
# To that end, the weight calculation will have access to a battle_side scope.
#
# A condition supports the following values:
# - icon: a path to an icon which will be used to display this condition; the
#		path is relative to the "game" directory
# - instant_switch: a trigger determining if the current battle condition should
#		be immediately switched to this other one (at the next check); weights are 
#		still considered if several instant_switch conditions apply; if empty,
#		this will never be checked and the condition can only appear randomly with
#		possible trigger and a positive weight
# - possible: a trigger determining if the weight should be evaluated at all; if 
#		empty, this will never be checked and can only appear under instant_switch
# - modifier: the modifier(s) that will impact this side of the battle
# - weight: a scripted value that represents how likely this condition is to be
#		picked among all the possible conditions. Has access to a battle_side scope
#		that can be used to make certain conditions more or less likely depending
#		on external factors such as commander traits, or even a commander not being
#		present. If unset, this is 1.
#
# Battle condition names are localized in their respective yml file. Similar to
# other database objects, the key of the condition is used to look for the
# localization of their name and description. Names are found by looking for
# `battle_condition_<key>` keys, while description are found by looking for
# `battle_condition_<key>_desc` keys. For example a battle condition called
# `test_condition` would have its name localized by adding
# `battle_condition_test_condition` to the localization file, while its
# description would be found via `battle_condition_test_condition_desc`.
#
# A battle_side scope has access to the following links:
# - battle: scope to the overall battle itself
# - commander: scope to the commander in charge of this side of the battle. Note
#       that it's perfectly possible that a battle_side is not led by
#       any commander at all
# - province: scope to the province the battle is being fought in
# - state: scope to the state that contains the province where the battle is
#       being fought
# - state_region: scope to the state region that contains the province where
#       the battle is being fought
# - country: scope to the country involved in this side of the battle
#
# Example:
#
#example_condition = {
#	icon = "/path/to/icon"
#
#	modifier = {
#		battle_combat_effectiveness_mult = 0.1
#	}
#
#	weight = {
#		value = 0
#
#		if = {
#			limit = {
#				commander = { has_trait = some_trait }
#			}
#			add = 10
#		}
#	}
#}
