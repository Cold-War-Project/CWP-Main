lesson_name = {	# arbitrary name
	chain = X				# The lesson belongs to this lesson chain, current chain lessons are preferred when picking which lesson to show.

	start_automatically = yes/no	# Does the lesson start automatically if the trigger is fulfilled? Use the start_tutorial_lesson effect to manually start such lessons on user actions. Default: yes
	trigger = { ... }		# The trigger has to be true for the lesson to start.

	window_name = X			# The pop up used for the lesson, default "tutorial_popup"
	gui_tag = X				# When any of this lesson's step is active, the specified tag is set and can be detected by IsTutorialTagOpen('X') in gui. There can be multiple gui_tag properties.
	highlight_widget = X	# When any of this lesson's step is active, the specified GUI widget (widgetid or name) will be highlighted. The widget's name should be unique for the functionality to work properly. Can not parse data functions.
	highlight_widget_dynamic_loc = "[Data_Function_X]"	# Same as above. However, this should only be used when a data function is required to specify which widget to look for. This also sends the specified string through loc, so be mindful that it should not match any loc-key name.
	highlight_target = X	# When any of this lesson's step is active, the specified event target will be highlighted.
	trigger_transition = { ... }	# This trigger transition can happen whenever any of the lesson steps are active. There can be multiple trigger transitions. See the lesson step trigger transition documentation.

	delay = X				# The lesson start will be delayed by that many seconds.
	default_lesson_step_delay = X	# The default delay for the lesson steps of this lesson.

	finish_gamestate_tutorial = yes/no		# Disables the "railroaded" tutorial mode when the lesson is done. See save_progress_in_gamestate in tutorial chains. Default: no

	shown_in_encyclopedia = yes/no 		# Is this lesson shown in the encyclopedia. Default: yes
	
	lesson_step_1 = { # arbitrary name
		text = X				# The localization key of the text shown for this lesson.
		
		# A button transition, there can be multiple transitions. The player has to click the corresponding button for it to happen.
		gui_transition = {
			button_id = X		# Arbitrary string used to determine which button the transition is attached to. Look for usages of "Tutorial.HasTransition" etc in the tutorial_window GUI script. The "next" ID is used to show instructions to the player (see enabled below).
			button_text = X		# The localization key of the text shown on the button.
			target = ...		# See target in trigger_transition above
			enabled = { ... }	# Optional trigger to disable the button. The trigger description of the button with button_id "next" (define TUTORIAL_STEP_INSTRUCTION_BUTTON_ID) will be shown in the tutorial window as instructions.
		}
		# Triggered transition, will proceed automatically when the trigger is fulfilled. Can have an optional dummy button to show instructions to the player.
		trigger_transition = {
			trigger = { ... }	# The transition will happen when this trigger is evaluated to true.
			# target can be on of:
			target = X			# Name of the step to transition to
					lesson_finish		# Finishes the leson
					lesson_abort		# Aborts the lesson
			button_id = X		# Optional. See gui_transition above. If present, will show a disabled button, and possibly show instructions to the player. Since the transition is automatic, the player will never actually click on the button.
			button_text = X		# Ignored if no button_id. See gui_transition above.
		}
		# The difference between a trigger_transition with a button_id and a gui_transition with an enabled trigger is that the trigger_transition
		# will proceed automatically when the condition is fulfilled, while the gui_transition will enable the button when the condition is
		# fulfilled and wait for the player to click on the button.

		gui_tag = X				# See gui_tag for lesson. Lesson and lesson step gui tags are added together.
		window_name = X			# The pop up used for the step, uses lesson window if not specified
		highlight_widget = X	# See highlight_widget for lesson. Lesson and lesson step gui tags are added together.
		soundeffect/voice = X	# The sound effect that should be played when this lesson is shown.
		repeat_sound_effect = yes/no	# If set to yes, the sound effect will repeat every time this lesson step is shown. Otherwise, it will only play once. Yes by default
		delay = X				# The lesson step window will show with this delay.
		animation = X			# The lesson step window will perform this animation.

		# The following require save_progress_in_gamestate = yes in the chain:
		pause_game = yes/no			# If set to yes, this lesson step will pause the game, but it can be unpaused manually. No by default.
		force_pause_game = yes/no	# If set to no, this lesson step will pause the game and it cannot be unpaused manually. No by default.
		effect = { ... }		# This effect will fire when the tutorial transitions to this lesson step
