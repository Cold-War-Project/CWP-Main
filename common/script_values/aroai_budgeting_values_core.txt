# Government buildings do not typically produce goods, so it is not possible to judge their productivity. Instead, it is
# necessary to establish a special measure of their importance and the quantity needed by a country.

# When it comes to ports, the goal is to have enough to facilitate the growth of trade routes, as it is a self-sustaining
# investment. Having more ports than necessary would be a waste of money. However, we never downsize them as they're
# usually insignificant spending.

# University and bureaucracy have a special system, I won't describe them as they'll probably be reworked at some point.

# This leaves us with the military and construction sectors. A country can be in one of two states: industrialized or
# industrializing. In order to employ its citizens as quickly as possible, a country is considered industrialized if it
# can provide employment for almost all of its unemployed citizens by the end of the year, including the yearly pop growth.
# (1) aroai_revenue_left_for_construction_military is the country balance without any military or construction ongoing.
# (2) aroai_construction_defense_maximum_from_budget is 75% of that balance.
# (3) aroai_construction_defense_maximum_from_pop is what's required for reaching/keeping full employment by next year.
# Note that (3) take account of the investment pool, but won't go below a threshold to keep being able to build things.
# The country allocate (1) - min((2),(3)) for the military. This is the defense the military sector will try to achieve.
# (4) aroai_construction_points_wanted_for_gov is the actual budget allocated for the construction, which is (1) -
# military defense, as the country try to achieve a 0 weekly balance at all time. This is because the military defense
# are very rigid, while construction defense are flexible.
